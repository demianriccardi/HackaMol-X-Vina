recommendations:
1. in a working directory:
  have three directories of data:

    centers/   whatever is in here, have a yaml file with a set of centers
               corresponding to each receptor or set of receptors
    receptors/ pdbqt files for receiving molecule generated from MGLTools
    ligands/   sets of json files generated from big db of pdbqt files 

  and then directories for work and analysis
    forfunNCI/
    biznesZINC/
    etc.
  
2. within the working directory, the first screen or dock should pull from the ligands/ 
  databases, but write to local databases (in new scratch dirs). the next screens can
  read and write to the same scratch directory (now also data).
