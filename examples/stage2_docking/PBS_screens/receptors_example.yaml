# YAML configuration file for virtual screen:
# 
#   perl broadcast.pl this.yaml 
# 
# will generate a configuration yaml in 'scratch' and broadcast a call on ligands_dock.pl 
# for each json file contained in 'data' to the PBS queueing system. Docking output will 
# be written to a json file in 'scratch'.  'scratch' and 'data' can point to the same path,
# and often they will be. I recommend keeping a pristine starting set of jsons for spawning
# "new beginnings" (i.e. let them be separate for the first screen and then switch data from
# the pristine to your new dirty scratch space) 
#
# See broadcast.pl and ligands_dock.pl for more info.
#
# The ligands and centers will be changed most frequently, so we start here
